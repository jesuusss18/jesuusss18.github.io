                <p>Soccer is my favorite hobby because it is a sport that combines excitement, skill, and teamwork. Playing on the field keeps me active and energized while also helping me build discipline and focus. Beyond the physical aspect, soccer teaches valuable lessons about collaboration and perseverance, as every match requires working together and never giving up. I love soccer!</p>
